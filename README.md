# markdown-tools

A fun collection of different tools which transform markdown to different markdown in some or other useful way.

## TODO

[ ] make a justfile for sequential application of all the tools?

[ ] make snippet-extractor optionally emit relative paths

[ ] remove file content from snippets?
