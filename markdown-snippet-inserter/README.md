# snippet extractor

Modify code snippets in markdown files, for example by adding a playground button or a vscode-open button

Use a div/p/button tag soup to add a button in the top right corner which uses (as of now) the vscode URL handler to open the current snippet in vscode. This means the local snippet must be present.
