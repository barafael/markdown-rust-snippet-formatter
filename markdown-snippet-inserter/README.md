# snippet extractor

Extract marked snippets from text files, for example to insert them in markdown-based presentations.

Use a div/p/button tag soup to add a button in the top right corner which uses (as of now) the vscode URL handler to open the current snippet in vscode. This means the local snippet must be present.
